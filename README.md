# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients. The gradient may fail to render due to several reasons, including incorrect configuration, CSS specificity issues, or plugin conflicts. 

## Bug Description

A simple div with a gradient background using Tailwind CSS classes does not render the expected gradient. The div appears with the correct padding and styling, but the gradient is either missing or incorrectly displayed.  See `bug.js` for a code example.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the Tailwind CSS configuration, resolving CSS specificity conflicts, and checking for plugin conflicts. `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.
