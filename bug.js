```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p class="text-white text-xl font-bold">Gradient Background</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a div with a gradient background.  However, if the gradient doesn't appear or renders incorrectly, several issues may be at play:

1. **Missing or Incorrect configuration:** Ensure that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and that the `@tailwind directives` are in your CSS file.  A common error is forgetting to run `npm run build` (or the equivalent) to build your Tailwind styles.
2. **Plugin Issues:** If using a plugin that affects gradients, it may conflict with the default Tailwind implementation. Verify the plugin's configuration and whether it needs specific setup instructions or requires additional peer dependencies.
3. **CSS Specificity:**  Overriding styles from other sources (e.g., inline styles, styles from another CSS file with higher specificity) might prevent the gradient from being applied. Try using !important (although this is generally discouraged), temporarily, to debug specificity problems. This can point you in the right direction. 
4. **Browser Compatibility:**  While rare, some very old browsers might not fully support the `linear-gradient` function used by Tailwind for gradients.  Check your browser's developer tools for errors.
5. **Typographical Errors:** Double-check for typos in the class names. Even a minor spelling mistake will prevent the class from being applied.
